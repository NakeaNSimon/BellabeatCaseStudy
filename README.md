The CEO of Bellabeat has tasked me with analyzing smart device usage data to gain insights into how consumers utilize non-Bellabeat smart devices. Following this analysis, she has requested that I choose one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in my presentation. The insights I discover will then help guide the marketing strategy for the company. I will present my analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with high-level recommendations for Bellabeatâ€™s marketing strategy.
